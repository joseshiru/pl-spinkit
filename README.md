# PL-Spinkit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joseshiru/pl-spinkit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joseshiru/pl-spinkit)


Are you thinking to use the awesome [Spinkit](https://github.com/tobiasahlin/SpinKit/) but you don't want to create all the logic to hide, show and destroy the spinners? 

Then, you're in the right place:

PL-Spinkit is a [p-loading](https://github.com/joseshiru/p-loading) add-on that allows you to use the Spinkit spinners as a jQuery plugin. You'll be able to display the spinner you want in the HTML element you want, by only using javascript.

Something like this will be the way how you will use it: 

    $('#YOUR_ELEMEMT').ploading({action: 'show'});

> You can show and hide them and to use all the nice features of
> p-loading plugin
